# Weather Dashboard

## Description

The goal for this project was to build a weather dashboard using the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities. The user can input and submit a search for a city and the current day's weather will show up along with a 5-day forecast for that particular city.
