# Weather Dashboard

## Description

The goal for this project was to build a weather dashboard using the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api). The user can input and submit a search for a city and the current day's weather will be displayed along with a 5-day forecast for that particular city. The user's search history is kept in a list and also displayed once a search is done. The user may click on a city in the search history list to display that city's weather data again.
